# H1 Old House New Home

*Milestone 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute*

## H2 UX
This website is aimed primarily at Irish home buyers or homeowners. In designing the website, I was trying to create what would have been helpful to us when we first started extending and renovating, while address some of the problems we found with similar websites.

1.	Anyone renovating lives on Pinterest. It’s so much easier to add to your Pinterest page if the pin icon is included. I’ve included the icon in the header so it’s always visible.
2.	When you spot something that’s perfect for your renovation in an image, often there’s no sourcing information. Supplier links are a huge part of this website, both to specific items featured and more general supplier links in the favourites section. 
3.	Some of the interior design sites out there are just that – design sites. The homes featured are not meant to be lived in. I wanted to ensure we had some reality so included reviews and opinions throughout – yes the Smeg looks beautiful but try keeping the surface smudge free!

Here are some user stories for potential visitors to the website:

**Extending** *I’m looking to extend an existing property.*
I need to come up with a brief for my architect detailing my needs and design preferences. I visit the extend section of the website and see a clear list of design considerations, sample drawings and supplier links. I add a selection of images to my Pinterest page using the Pinterest save icon which I can share with my architect. I download and print the drawings using the download drawings button to sketch my ideas over. I visit one of the supplier links, Resicrete, as I have not considered resin flooring and the homeowner notes it as budget friendly.
**Downsizing** *I’m looking to downsize to a smaller space.*
As retired empty nesters we are looking to downsize but are unsure how to make the best use of space in a smaller home. We visit the small spaces section of the website. We watch the video on sleeping lofts and visit the suppliers site using the sourcing button. We save the image of the loft to our pinterest page using the pinterest save icon as this is something our grandchildren would love. We complete the contact form asking the homeowner for more information on their experiences purchasing and installing the loft.
**Kitchen Remodel** *I’m looking to remodel my kitchen.*
Having lived in the house for a number of years I’ve saved up to remodel my kitchen. I visit the kitchen section of the website. I view the carousel of kitchen images. The cooker catches my eye. I see the homeowner gave the cooker 3 stars. I click the review button to see a breakdown of the review. I then click the source button on the review to visit the brands website as I’m interested in a wider 90cm model.
**Rennovation** *I’m preparing for a renovation.*
After recently closing on a house purchase, I’m looking to plan the renovations. I’m particularly interested in light fittings. I save the light fitting images to my Pinterest page using the Pinterest save icon. I visit lighting in the favourites section of the website, read the card and visit the supplier links using the source button. I complete the contact form asking the homeowner where they would recommend sourcing interesting bathroom light fittings.
**House Hunting** *I’m currently house hunting.*
I need some inspiration to help me see the potential in the properties I’m viewing. I view all sections of the website. I save several images to my Pinterest page using the Pinterest save icon. I download the drawings using download drawings button. I visit some of the supplier links using the source buttons.
